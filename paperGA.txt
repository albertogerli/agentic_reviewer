However, it remains unclear whether 11 these risks translated into higher all-cause mortality. 12 13 Methods: We analysed mortality and population data from 16 European countries to estimate excess14 16 mortality among individuals aged 25–49 years during the period 2020–2024. Excess mortality was 17 18 defined as the difference between observed and expected age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs). 19 Expected values were derived using four regression models: (1) assuming a long-term linear trend based 21 22 on 2010–2019 data; (2) a non-linear trend using the same 2010–2019 baseline; (3) a short-term linear 23 24 trend based on 2015–2019 data; and (4) no-trend using 2019 data alone. 26 Results: Assuming a continuous decreasing mortality trend, most countries showed excess mortality 27 28 29 both during the pandemic (2020–2022) and in the post-pandemic period (2023–2024). All models consistently estimated substantial excess mortality in 2021 in Bulgaria (ranging from 28.5% to 35.6% 31 32 in males, 37.2%–44.3% in females), Hungary (28.6%–47.3% in males, 29.1%–40.5% in females), 33 34 Poland (17.7%–25.7% in males, 24.4%–30.4% in females), and Slovakia (27.9%–37.7% in males, 36 37 21.8%–26.2% in females). Excess mortality persisted through 2022–2024 when linear trend models 38 39 were applied but largely disappeared under the no-trend model. 41 Conclusions: While our analysis indicates substantial excess mortality in 2021 among adults aged 25– 42 43 49 in some Eastern European countries, the findings do not support a sustained post-acute impact of 44 COVID-19 on all-cause mortality in this age group. The estimates were sensitive to the choice of 46 47 baseline period used to model expected mortality, underscoring the importance of presenting results 48 49 under multiple analytical assumptions. 51 52 53 54 Keywords: excess mortality, COVID-19, pandemic, young adults, Europe 56 57 58 59 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 29 31 32 33 34 36 37 38 39 41 42 43 44 46 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 56 57 58 59 KEY MESSAGES What is already known on this topic Most research on excess mortality during the acute phase of the pandemic and the following years has focused primarily on older populations. In contrast, data on individuals under 50 years of age remain limited. What this study adds This study estimates excess mortality among individuals aged 25–49 in 16 European countries with populations over 5 million, using different modelling approaches that vary in baseline reference periods and time trend specifications. The models consistently estimate notably high excess mortality in 2021 in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. In contrast, the models do not estimate sustained excess mortality in subsequent years. Estimates of excess mortality at these ages are highly sensitive to modelling choices. How this study might affect research, practice or policy The substantial excess mortality in this younger age group is particularly concerning from both public health and societal perspectives, as it impacts a typically active segment of the population generally considered at lower risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Targeted national investigations are crucial to understand the underlying causes of this excess mortality and to enhance the preparedness of national health systems for potential health emergencies. 1 2 3 INTRODUCTION 4 A range of excess total mortality estimates during the COVID-19 pandemic has been produced by 6 7 different research groups and international organizations [1–4]. These estimates consistently indicate 8 9 that excess mortality was highest among older adults. However, emerging evidence suggests that young 11 adults experiencing post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 are also at increased risk of several cardiovascular 12 13 events, including atrial fibrillation, acute ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombotic 14 16 complications (such as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis), and myocarditis [5]. Still, the 17 18 quantification of the excess risk – if any – remains elusive. 19 A recent study based on French data reported persistent excess mortality in the country through 2023, 21 22 highlighting the growing contribution of deaths among individuals under age 60 to the total number of 23 24 years of life lost between 2020 and 2023 [6]. The share attributable to this age group increased from 26 17% in 2020 to 50% in 2023. 27 28 Despite these findings, the impact of the acute phase of the pandemic or its post-acute sequelae on29 mortality among young adults remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study31 32 to evaluate excess mortality among individuals aged 25–49 from the onset of the pandemic in 2020 33 34 through the end of 2024. 36 37 38 39 MATERIALS 41 Data sources 42 43 Weekly death counts for the 25-49 age group were obtained from the Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations 44 (STMF) dataset of the Human Mortality Database with last update on 25th April 2025 [7]. Deaths counts 46 47 from 2010 to 2024 were aggregated into annual counts by country, year, sex, and age group (25-29, 30.48 49 34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49 years). The analysis includes countries with a resident population of at least 51 five million and available mortality data disaggregated by sex and age group. 52 53 54 Mid-year population estimates for the same age groups, disaggregated by country, year, and sex, were 56 obtained from the World Population Prospects 2024 of the United Nations [8]. Data from the 57 58 “Estimates” series were used for the years up to 2023, while the “Medium fertility variant” projections 59 were used for 2024. 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 29 31 32 33 34 36 37 38 39 41 42 43 44 46 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 56 57 58 59 The studied included 16 countries with complete mortality data available through 2024: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Sweden. Estimation of excess mortality Excess mortality was calculated as the relative difference between the observed age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR per 100,000) and the expected ASMR for 2020-2024, (ASMRobserved – ASMRexpected)/ASMR expected] x 100. The ASMR were calculated as age-specific mortality rates multiplied by the 2013 revision of the European standard population weights. The estimates were provided separately for sex, country and calendar year. The expected ASMR was derived from projected death counts, estimated using statistical modelling. To assess the sensitivity of excess mortality estimates to different modelling choices — particularly regarding the selection of baseline reference periods and the specification of time trends — we developed four alternative mortality projections for 2020–2024: 1. Long-term linear trend: using 2010–2019 as the baseline reference period, assuming a linear time trend; 1. Long-term non-linear trend: using 2010–2019 as the baseline reference period, allowing for a non-linear time trend; 2. Short-term linear trend: using 2015–2019 as the baseline reference period, assuming a linear time trend; 3. No trend: using 2019 alone as the baseline, with no time trend applied. For each country, annual death counts (D) were modelled as a function of sex, age and time (calendar year) using quasi-Poisson regression: ....(..[....,..,..]) = ......,.. + ..(..)+ ....(....,..,..) Where: 1 2 3 • .Xs,a represents the contribution of sex and age group (25-29, 30-34, …, 45-49) to the expected 4 number of deaths; 6 7 8 • f(T) represents the function used to model temporal trends. For linear trend models: f(T) = .T + 9 .(Sex x T), allowing different trends for males and females. For the non-linear trend model: f(t) 11 12 = .(Sex) x ns(T), denoting sex-specific smoothing functions, specified as natural cubic splines 13 14 of year with a single knot placed at the median. For the no-trend model: the f(T) component was 16 not included. 17 18 • The term ln(P) is the natural logarithm of the mid-year population, included as an offset term. 19 All models incorporated a scale parameter (.) to account for overdispersion in death counts, relaxing 21 22 the Poisson mean-variance equality assumption. 23 24 For Italy, the long-term trend models excluded 2010 from the baseline period due to unavailability of 26 mortality data for that year. 27 28 The expected number of deaths obtained from the above-described models were used to calculate the 29 31 expected ASMR. 32 33 To estimate the uncertainty around the excess mortality, we employed a Monte Carlo simulation. For 34 each country and model, we generated 5000 simulated values of the expected ASMR by drawing from 36 37 a normal distribution with the estimated mean (expected ASMR) and its standard error. The distribution 38 39 of the excess mortality was obtained by subtracting each simulated expected ASMR from the observed 41 ASMR. The standard deviation of the resulting excess ASMR values was taken as the standard error of 42 43 the excess. Using this estimated standard error, we constructed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 44 46 excess ASMR by applying the normal approximation. Observed mortality was considered significantly 47 different from expected mortality when the 95% CI of the relative difference in ASMR did not include 48 49 zero. 51 52 53 54 RESULTS 56 In 2024, the number of female deaths in this age group ranged from 453 in Norway to 6233 in France, 57 58 while the number of male deaths ranged between 846 in Denmark to 16,549 in Poland. Among both 59 sexes, the highest ASMRs were observed in Bulgaria, with 250.6 deaths per 100,000 males and 116.7 6 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 29 31 32 33 34 36 37 38 39 41 42 43 44 46 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 56 57 58 59 deaths per 100,000 females. The lowest rates were reported in Switzerland, with 79.8 deaths per 100,000 males and 43.9 per 100,000 females, corresponding to an over 3-fold differences in males and 2-fold differences in females. The number of deaths among individuals aged 25–49 years, along with the corresponding ASMR by sex and calendar year, for the 16 countries included in this analysis are reported in the Supplement (Table 1). Figures 1–2 show the observed ASMRs and those estimated by the four regression models for males and females, respectively. In both sexes, the expected ASMRs under the short- and long-term linear models were generally lower than those estimated under the non-linear trend or no-trend assumptions. The model assuming no trend tended to yield the highest estimates of expected deaths. Tables 2-3 show the estimated excess mortality for each of the four regression models among males and females, respectively. In 2020, the long-term linear model indicated excess mortality among males ranging from 6% to 18% in all countries except Sweden. Among women, significant excess mortality (approximately 9%–14%) was observed in Bulgaria, Switzerland, Spain, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Portugal. When expected deaths were estimated using a shorter reference period or a non-linear trend, the number of countries with excess mortality decreased. For men, excess mortality remained significant in nine countries (Bulgaria, Spain, Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Slovakia), and for women, in five countries (Bulgaria, Spain, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Norway). When a non-linear trend was applied, excess mortality was observed in seven countries among males (Bulgaria, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Portugal) and in only two countries among females (Spain and the Netherlands). Under a no-trend model, no significant excess mortality was found, except among males in the Netherlands. In 2021, substantial and consistent excess mortality was observed in both sexes in Bulgaria (28.5%– 35.6% in males and 37.2%–44.3% in females), Hungary (28.6%–47.3% in males and 29.1%–40.5% in females), Poland (17.7%–25.7% in males and 24.4%–30.4% in females), and Slovakia (27.9%–37.7% in males and 21.8%–26.2% in females). In the Netherlands, significant excess mortality was observed only among females (9.3%–15.9%). These estimates correspond to an approximate number of excess 1 2 3 deaths ranging from 1600 to 1800 in Bulgaria, 1500 to 1800 in Hungary, 4200 to 5900 in Poland, and 4 100 to 200 in the Netherlands. 6 7 In 2022, the long-term linear model estimated significant excess mortality among males in all countries, 8 9 and among females in seven countries (Spain, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and 11 Portugal). Under the short-term model, significant excess mortality was found in eight countries among 12 13 males(Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Spain, Hungary, Italy, and Portugal) and in two countries among 14 16 females (the Netherlands and Norway). When non-linear trends were allowed, excess mortality was 17 18 observed in three countries among males (Spain, Portugal, and Slovakia) and only in the Netherlands 19 among women. Under the no-trend model, significant excess mortality was observed only in Slovakia 21 22 among men, and in the Netherlands and Norway among women. 23 24 In 2023 and 2024, excess mortality persisted in several countries when applying the long-term linear 26 model, particularly among men. However, under the non-linear trend model, only a few countries 27 28 continued to show significant excess mortality. In contrast, when no trend was assumed, observed 29 mortality was not significantly different from expected mortality in any country. 31 32 33 34 DISCUSSION 36 37 This study shows that during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, excess mortality also occurred 38 39 among young adults, with varying intensity across European countries. The largest excess occurred in 41 2021, where excess mortality exceeded 25% in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The study also 42 43 highlights the substantial influence of the chosen baseline reference period and the specifications of 44 temporal trends on excess mortality estimates. While estimates across different reference periods are 46 47 generally consistent during the acute phase, by 2023 and 2024, models that include short- or long-term 48 49 trends suggests persistent excess mortality, while assuming no trend yields no substantial excess. 51 The remarkable excess mortality observed in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia in 2021 is likely 52 53 54 due to multiple factors. Vaccines became widely available to the majority of these populations only in 56 the second half of 2021, and uptake of the primary vaccination course was particularly low in Bulgaria 57 58 (below 30%) compared to the European average of approximately 60% [9,10]. Moreover, older and 59 more vulnerable individuals were prioritized for vaccination, leaving many younger individuals 8 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 29 31 32 33 34 36 37 38 39 41 42 43 44 46 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 56 57 58 59 unvaccinated during that period. Beyond low vaccine coverage, these countries carry a high burden of preventable and treatable conditions—such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer—which contribute to a larger population of clinically vulnerable individuals [11,12]. Many of them may not have received adequate care during the acute phase of the pandemic. Although the sensitivity of excess mortality estimates to baseline reference period selection has been extensively studied in all-age mortality [13], it has not been thoroughly evaluated in younger populations, where the phenomenon may be amplified due to the relatively low number of deaths and the higher between-country variability. Projecting the pre-pandemic trends in mortality to 2020–2024 generally results in lower expected death counts compared to assuming no trend, thereby increasing the estimated excess mortality. However, in several countries, mortality rates had plateaued prior to the pandemic. In such cases, applying a linear trend may underestimate the expected deaths and thus overestimate excess mortality. The stagnation in total mortality among young adults is likely due to a slowdown in the decline of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality over the past decade across most countries included in our analysis. In high-income countries, CVD mortality began to decrease sharply in the 1970s, with age.adjusted mortality rates dropping to about one-third of their 1960s levels by 2000 [14]. This remarkable decline was driven by substantial advances in both prevention and treatment, including dramatic reductions in cigarette smoking, improved hypertension management, widespread use of statins and, more recently other drugs to lower cholesterol, and the development and timely application of thrombolysis and stents in acute coronary syndrome to control or prevent infarction [15]. However, in the past decade, there have been no major breakthroughs in CVD prevention or treatment, and smoking among young adults has levelled off [16]. At the same time, rising rates of obesity and diabetes has contributed to sustaining high rates of CVD cases [17,18]. While cancer, suicide, and traffic accidents remain other leading causes of death in this age group, mortality from these causes has generally continued to decline in recent years and is therefore unlikely to explain the stagnation in total mortality [19–21]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate excess mortality among young adults during both the pandemic and the recovery phase, with cross-country comparisons across Europe. Sex and age are 9 1 2 3 key factors when comparing mortality metrics, including excess mortality, across countries [22]. This 4 study accounted for both by providing sex-specific estimates and age-standardized estimates to adjust 6 7 for differences in population age structures across countries. 8 9 This study shares the same limitations as other studies aiming to estimate excess mortality. The 11 estimation process involves several methodological decisions for which no universal consensus exists.12 13 A key step is selecting a reference baseline period—a past timeframe used to project expected deaths in 14 16 subsequent years—and defining the projection period during which observed deaths are compared to 17 18 these expectations. It is also necessary to assess whether time-related trends in mortality exist and, if so, 19 to determine their appropriate form. Empirical studies and simulations have shown that these 21 22 methodological choices can significantly influence expected number of deaths and hence excess 23 24 mortality estimates [23]. 26 To address this issue, we provided three different estimates based on varying assumptions about time 27 28 29 trends: one assuming a long-term trend using 2010–2019 as the baseline; another assuming a short-term trend using 2015–2019; and a third using only 2019, thereby assuming no trend. These alternative 31 32 approaches were used to test the robustness of our findings and reducing reliance on subjective 33 34 modelling choices. This approach is especially important for young adults, where estimating excess 36 37 mortality is challenging due to the relatively low number of deaths and high variability in mortality rates 38 39 across countries. 41 In conclusion, excess mortality among the young population was substantial and heterogeneous across 42 43 Europe in 2020–2021. However, following the end of the acute phase of the pandemic, no consistent 44 excess was observed. As showed, by our analysis, it is important to consider multiple scenarios when 46 47 projecting expected mortality. 48 49 51 Author contributions: Gianfranco Alicandro: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal Analysis,52 53 54 Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing -original draft.
