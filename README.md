# Project

A Python project integrating LangChain, OpenAI, and related tooling. This repository includes modular components for building agentic workflows.

- Status: alpha (0.1.0)
- Python: >= 3.10

## Installation

- Editable install for local development:
  - pip install -e .

- Optional: install dev tools
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Quick start

- Environment
  - Copy .env.example to .env and provide required variables (e.g., OpenAI credentials if applicable)

- Run tests
  - pytest -q

- Examples
  - See examples/ for runnable notebooks or scripts

## Usage

Below is a high-level example outline. Adapt to the concrete classes/functions in this repository.

- Import your core modules
  - from agentic import ...
  - from agentic.orchestrator import ...
  - from agentic.agents import ...

- Minimal pattern (pseudo-code)
  - orchestrator = Orchestrator(...)
  - result = orchestrator.run(input={...})
  - print(result)

See examples/ and tests/ for concrete usages.

## Architecture

This project follows a modular layout to enable composability and testing. A conceptual view:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph Client
    U[User / App]
  end

  subgraph Core
    O[Orchestrator]
    A1[Agents]
    UTI[Utils]
  end

  subgraph Integrations
    LC[LangChain]
    OAI[OpenAI]
    TOK[Tiktoken]
  end

  U -->|requests| O
  O -->|delegates| A1
  A1 -->|helpers| UTI

  O --> LC
  O --> OAI
  O --> TOK
```

- Orchestrator: central coordinator for workflows
- Agents: specialized workers that perform tasks (retrieval, reasoning, formatting)
- Utils: shared utilities for logging, parsing, prompting, etc.
- Integrations: external libraries and APIs

## Development

- Code style
  - Ruff and Black configured via pyproject.toml
  - Line length: 100

- Pre-commit
  - Optionally enable hooks defined in .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - pre-commit install
