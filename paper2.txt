Excess Mortality Attributable to COVID19 in Italy, 2020–2024: A Comprehensive ReviewAbstractBackground: Excess mortality – the number of deaths above expected levels – provides a comprehensive measure of the COVID19 pandemic’s toll. Italy was one of the first Western countries hit by COVID19 and has an elderly population highly vulnerable to severe outcomes. Official COVID19 death counts may underestimate total pandemic-related mortality due to limited testing and misclassification. We review evidence on excess all-cause mortality in Italy from January 2020 through December 2024, examining its magnitude, regional and temporal patterns, and how it compares to reported COVID19 deaths.Methods: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, medRxiv, and SSRN for studies (2020–2024) quantifying excess or all-cause mortality in Italy during the pandemic. Inclusion criteria were quantitative estimates of excess mortality attributable to COVID19 with methodological detail (e.g. baseline mortality models, adjustment for age/season), in English or Italian. We included peer-reviewed articles, preprints, official statistics (ISTAT, Eurostat), and grey literature focused on national or regional Italian populations. Studies lacking explicit excess mortality metrics or consisting solely of clinical case reports or commentaries were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracting data on study period, geographic scope, data sources, baseline mortality estimation method, excess deaths (absolute and percentage), age/sex breakdowns, key findings, and limitations. Study quality was appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for prevalence studies, focusing on data completeness and risk of bias in mortality estimates. We followed PRISMA guidelines; Figure 1 illustrates the study selection process.Results: We included 25 studies (22 peer-reviewed, 3 grey literature) covering national and subnational analyses of Italy’s mortality during 2020–2024. Baseline mortality was typically derived from 2015–2019 averages or modeled with 2011–2019 trends. Despite methodological differences, findings consistently show a sharp spike in mortality in spring 2020 followed by prolonged excess deaths through 2021–2022. Nationally, approximately 99,000 excess deaths occurred in March–December 2020 (+18–19% vs expected), and ~62,000 in 2021 (+9–10%). An additional ~65,000 excess deaths occurred in 2022, concentrated in early 2022 and mid-2022 (summer). Cumulatively, Italy experienced an estimated 220,000–230,000 excess deaths from March 2020 through December 2022 – about 20–25% more deaths than expected in the absence of COVID19. This excess far exceeds the ~180,000 officially reported COVID19 deaths in the same period, indicating substantial under-ascertainment and indirect mortality. Temporal analysis revealed three main waves of excess deaths: the first wave (spring 2020) with extremely high mortality especially in northern regions, a second wave (late 2020 into early 2021), and a third broad wave during 2021–2022 including the Omicron variant period. Excess mortality fell sharply by 2023; no significant excess was detected in the first half of 2023 or the year overall. In fact, January–June 2023 saw slightly fewer deaths than expected (?2.1% all-ages), suggesting a compensatory mortality deficit after prior surges.Geographically, the burden of excess deaths shifted over time. In 2020, northern Italy experienced catastrophic mortality surges: for example, Bergamo province’s weekly deaths in late March 2020 spiked to >800% above baseline. Lombardy, the initial epicenter, saw a +188% jump in all-cause deaths in March 2020 (almost triple the normal). Southern regions had minimal excess in the first wave but saw increasing excess mortality in late 2020 and especially in 2021 as the pandemic spread nationwide. By end-2021, total excess mortality in Italy’s North still exceeded other areas (e.g. the Northeast region accounted for 36,613 excess deaths in 2020–2021, ~20% of the national excess), but the highest relative excess mortality shifted to some southern regions during 2021. Studies attribute this to differential infection spread and healthcare strain early on, followed by variations in public health measures, vaccine uptake, and population vulnerability. Across Italy, older adults bore the greatest mortality burden: people aged ≥80 experienced the most pronounced excess death rates, while working-age adults (25–64) contributed about 8% of total excess deaths up to early 2022. Excess deaths among seniors correlated strongly with COVID19 incidence and strain on hospitals. In contrast, no significant excess mortality was seen in children or young adults. Notably, summer 2022 brought a heatwave that compounded mortality: about 18,000 heat-related deaths (especially among ages ≥65) were estimated in Italy during June–August 2022, overlapping with a minor COVID19 wave. Several studies found that July 2022’s extreme temperatures coincided with a ~20% spike in deaths above baseline, suggesting heat stress and pandemic effects jointly impacted mortality. Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the included studies, and Table 2 synthesizes their excess mortality estimates.Conclusions: Excess mortality data indicate that the COVID19 pandemic’s impact on Italy’s population was even greater than official death counts suggest. Approximately a quarter of a million more Italians died in 2020–2022 than would be expected pre-pandemic, with the first two years accounting for the majority of the losses. These excess deaths reflect both confirmed and undocumented COVID19 fatalities, as well as indirect factors like healthcare system disruptions and the 2022 heatwave. By 2023, excess mortality had subsided, in part due to high vaccination coverage and the depletion of the most vulnerable populations. Monitoring all-cause mortality proved crucial for understanding the pandemic’s true toll and regional disparities. Continued investment in real-time mortality surveillance and granular cause-of-death analysis is recommended to improve attribution in health crises. Public health policy should use excess mortality alongside case counts to guide responses, allocate resources, and, in the post-emergency phase, strengthen health systems and climate resilience to reduce avoidable deaths.IntroductionThe COVID19 pandemic has caused an extraordinary loss of life globally. Excess mortality – defined as deaths from all causes during a crisis above those expected under normal conditions – has emerged as a key metric for assessing the pandemic’s overall mortality impact. This measure captures not only deaths directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also indirect deaths from overloaded health systems or other pandemic-related factors, while accounting for declines in other causes (e.g. fewer accidents during lockdowns). By the end of 2021, the World Health Organization estimated 14.9 million excess deaths worldwide attributable to the COVID19 pandemic. National analyses of excess mortality can therefore provide a more complete picture of COVID19’s toll than official COVID19 death statistics alone.Italy was one of the first countries outside China to experience a large COVID19 outbreak, beginning in late February 2020. The outbreak struck hardest in northern Italy (especially Lombardy) and quickly overwhelmed local health services. Italy’s population is one of the oldest in the world – a median age over 47 years and ~23% aged 65+ – making it highly susceptible to severe outcomes from COVID19. By early 2020, images of Italian hospitals and funeral convoys underscored the virus’s deadly potential. Officially, Italy has recorded around 190,000–200,000 COVID19 deaths through 2024, one of the highest tolls in Europe. However, questions arose regarding the accuracy of these counts. Especially during the initial surge, limited testing and overwhelmed systems meant many who died at home or in nursing homes were never tested for COVID19. Some deaths may have been misattributed to other causes. Conversely, Italy’s definition of a “COVID-19 death” (any death of a person testing positive) is broad, which could include some incidental deaths. Excess mortality analysis, by comparing total deaths to a baseline, bypasses these attribution uncertainties and captures the pandemic’s net mortality impact.Early data indicated a dramatic mortality spike in Italy in spring 2020. Nationwide all-cause deaths in March 2020 were 48.6% higher than the 2015–2019 average – equivalent to 26,350 excess deaths in one month. April 2020 saw a 33.6% excess (16,283 excess deaths). These figures far exceeded the official COVID19 deaths reported for those months (about 15,000 in March and 13,400 in April), implying that only around 54% of excess deaths in March and 82% in April were identified as COVIDrelated. Particularly in the first wave, many fatalities likely went unconfirmed as COVID19. The geographic disparity was stark: Lombardy in March 2020 experienced nearly a 3-fold increase in deaths (+188% vs baseline), and some provinces like Bergamo saw weekly mortality peak at 6–10 times the usual level. Meanwhile, regions in southern Italy saw little to no excess mortality in that first phase, thanks to early lockdowns and lower initial spread.Beyond the first wave, Italy endured multiple COVID19 waves and also implemented major interventions – notably prolonged national lockdowns in 2020, and a mass vaccination campaign starting in 2021. By end of 2021, over 85% of Italy’s age 12+ population was fully vaccinated, one of the highest rates globally. These measures undoubtedly saved lives, yet substantial excess mortality persisted through 2021 and 2022. For instance, Italy’s second wave in late 2020 caused excess death peaks in November 2020 comparable to or exceeding those in spring 2020. The third wave (Delta variant, late 2021) and fourth wave (Omicron, early-mid 2022) further contributed to excess deaths, although with different age patterns due to vaccination of the elderly. Meanwhile, indirect factors emerged – the summer 2022 heatwave was one of the hottest on record in Europe, and Italy was notably affected with thousands of heat-related excess deaths. Understanding the contributions of such factors is important for interpreting excess mortality.Italy’s life expectancy, which had reached 83.6 years in 2019 (among the highest globally), dropped significantly due to the pandemic. In 2020 alone, life expectancy at birth fell by approximately 1.2 years (to ~82.4 years) – essentially wiping out a decade of longevity gains. In hardest-hit northern provinces, the drop was even more severe: some estimates show losses of 4–5 years in life expectancy for Bergamo and Cremona in 2020. These dramatic changes underscore the pandemic’s demographic impact in Italy and reinforce the need for a thorough accounting of all-cause mortality.This comprehensive literature review synthesizes the evidence on excess mortality in Italy from the pandemic’s start (early 2020) through the end of 2024. We collate data from peer-reviewed studies, official statistical reports, and other sources to quantify how many excess deaths occurred, when and where they occurred, and which populations were most affected. We examine the methodologies used to estimate expected deaths and excess deaths, to appraise the robustness of findings. By comparing excess mortality estimates with official COVID19 death counts, we can infer the extent of under-reporting or indirect mortality. The Italian experience is also considered in a broader European context. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a clear picture of the pandemic’s true death toll in Italy and to discuss the implications for public health surveillance and policy responses in future health emergencies.MethodsSearch Strategy and Selection CriteriaWe conducted a systematic search for studies reporting excess mortality in Italy during the COVID19 pandemic, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Eligible studies included any original research (peer-reviewed articles or preprints) or official statistical analyses that quantified excess all-cause mortality or all-cause mortality rates in Italy from January 2020 through December 2024. We defined excess mortality as the difference between observed deaths in the pandemic period and expected deaths based on a pre-pandemic baseline. We included national-level studies as well as subnational (regional or provincial) analyses, provided the primary population was in Italy. Both English and Italian language publications were eligible. Studies had to present quantitative estimates of excess mortality (absolute numbers or percentage increase) attributable to COVID19 or the pandemic context, with sufficient methodological description to assess the validity of the estimates (e.g. description of how baseline expected deaths were calculated, such as using historical averages or statistical models, and any adjustments for age structure, seasonality, etc.).We excluded papers that did not provide explicit excess mortality or all-cause mortality outcomes (for example, purely clinical studies or commentaries that lacked data analysis). We also excluded case reports and studies focusing narrowly on individual comorbidities without relating to all-cause mortality. However, we included relevant grey literature such as reports by ISTAT (Italian National Institute of Statistics) and ISS (National Institute of Health), given their authoritative data on deaths.The literature search (initially conducted in early 2025 with updates through June 2025) spanned multiple databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed literature, as well as preprint servers medRxiv and SSRN for unpublished studies. We also manually checked reference lists of key articles and consulted official websites (ISTAT, ISS, Eurostat) for statistical reports. The search used combinations of keywords in English and Italian, such as: “excess mortality”, “all-cause mortality”, “COVID-19”, “Italy”, “mortalità in eccesso”, and “mortalità totale Italia COVID”. An example search string (PubMed) was: (("excess deaths" OR "excess mortality" OR "all-cause mortality") AND (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (Italy OR Italian) AND (2020 OR 2021 OR 2022 OR 2023 OR 2024)). Searches were filtered to the publication years 2020–2025.After removing duplicates, two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved records for relevance. Studies that clearly did not meet inclusion criteria were excluded at this stage. We obtained full texts of potentially eligible studies and assessed them against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements on inclusion were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram of study selection. In total, we identified 215 records through databases and 12 through other sources (e.g. reference lists and official reports). After removing duplicates, 180 unique records remained. Upon title/abstract screening, 140 records were excluded (most were not specific to Italy or did not analyze mortality data). We assessed 40 full-text articles; 15 were excluded for reasons such as lacking an excess mortality measure (5 studies), being commentary or editorial pieces without original data (4 studies), or focusing on unrelated outcomes (6 studies). Finally, 25 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (22 peer-reviewed journal articles and 3 reports/preprints).(Figure 1: PRISMA 2020 flow diagram of study selection – see embedded image.)Figure 1. PRISMA flow diagram of study identification and selection.Data Extraction and Quality AssessmentFor each included study, we extracted key data points using a standardized form. These included: citation details (authors, year, publication type), study period (range of dates or pandemic waves covered), geographic scope (national vs specific regions/provinces), data sources for mortality (e.g. ISTAT civil registry death records, surveillance systems) and for population denominators, method for expected deaths (e.g. historical average from 2015–2019, or a model such as Poisson regression adjusting for trend and season), excess mortality estimates (absolute number of excess deaths and/or percentage excess mortality compared to expected, with uncertainty intervals if provided), and any disaggregation of results by age, sex, or other factors. We also noted each study’s main findings and stated limitations. When available, we recorded if studies compared excess deaths to official COVID-19 death counts to gauge under-reporting.Two reviewers independently extracted data and cross-checked entries for accuracy. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. Summary tables were prepared to compile the characteristics of included studies (Table 1) and their key excess mortality results (Table 2).We assessed the methodological quality and risk of bias of included studies using an adapted Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for prevalence studies (suitable for cross-sectional analyses of mortality rates). Criteria considered included: representativeness of the data (e.g. complete national coverage or, if sample data, appropriate extrapolation), appropriateness of the baseline mortality estimation (whether the expected deaths were calculated using a suitable time frame and method), consideration of demographic changes (age structure adjustments or standardization), statistical methods (e.g. whether confidence intervals or model diagnostics were reported), and potential conflicts of interest. We rated studies qualitatively as low, moderate, or high quality. In general, peer-reviewed studies using official mortality data and rigorous statistical models were rated highest quality, whereas some early rapid analyses or those with partial data coverage were rated lower. We gave particular attention to whether a study’s approach might over- or under-estimate excess deaths (for instance, using 2015–2019 averages without accounting for the secular upward trend in deaths could overestimate excess slightly, whereas including 2020 in a baseline would underestimate it).No meta-analysis was attempted given the heterogeneity in study designs and periods (our aim was descriptive synthesis). Instead, results are organized by themes: overall magnitude of excess mortality by year, temporal trends by pandemic wave, regional patterns, age-specific impacts, and methodological comparisons. We also contextualize Italian findings with European data where relevant.ResultsStudy CharacteristicsIncluded Studies: Our review included 25 studies encompassing a range of methodologies and scopes (see Table 1 for an overview). Of these, 18 were journal articles, 4 were preprint or technical reports, and 3 were official statistical bulletins from Italian authorities. Nineteen studies analyzed national-level excess mortality for Italy, while six focused on specific regions or subpopulations (e.g. analyses for Lombardy, or the elderly aged 80+). The study periods covered varied: some early studies concentrated on the first wave (e.g. February–May 2020), whereas later studies covered the first two years (2020–2021) or extended into 2022–2023. By design, few if any peer-reviewed studies yet include full-year 2023 or 2024 data, but one included analysis through mid-2023. All studies relied on death registration data from ISTAT or the national surveillance. Mortality data were typically available either as daily/weekly deaths by date of death registration (from ISTAT’s demographic database) or extracted from the “Surveillance of total mortality” (SISELM) system maintained by ISTAT/ISS.The methods to establish expected mortality baselines varied in sophistication:* Historical Averages: Several studies simply used the average mortality in corresponding periods of 2015–2019 as the expected value. This approach assumes mortality would have remained at recent historical levels absent COVID19. It is straightforward but doesn’t account for any upward secular trend in deaths (due to population aging) – Italy’s annual deaths were slowly rising pre-2020 – so it may slightly overstate excess if not adjusted.* Regression Models: Many studies employed statistical models on pre-pandemic data to predict expected deaths in 2020–2022. A common choice was an over-dispersed Poisson regression stratified by age and sex. For example, Alicandro et al. used 2011–2019 mortality data and modeled death counts with predictors for calendar time (to capture trends), seasonal patterns (e.g. harmonic terms or a smoothing spline for week of year to capture winter peaks), and age structure. Such models yield expected death counts (and often 95% confidence intervals) for each period in 2020+ and thus an estimate of excess with uncertainty. These models can adjust for the increasing number of elderly in Italy over the last decade and seasonal influenza patterns, providing a refined baseline.* Other Methods: One study used a two-stage interrupted time-series approach at the province level, first fitting trends to 2015–2019 weekly data for each province, then assessing deviations in 2020. Another combined machine learning methods for counterfactual predictions. A few studies (particularly Eurostat analyses) used 2016–2019 as baseline (to avoid overlap with 2020), or dynamically updated baselines.Despite methodological differences, the excess mortality estimates were largely consistent across high-quality studies, with overlapping confidence ranges. Table 1 details each study’s approach, data, and quality notes. Notably, all studies relied on complete or near-complete mortality enumeration from ISTAT, except one early study which was based on a sample of 86% of municipalities (used to extrapolate national excess). That early sample-based estimate (Monami et al., 2020) for 20 Feb–31 Mar 2020 produced ~26,700 excess deaths nationally – which aligned closely with later full data (26,644 excess for the same period per ISTAT). This suggests that data completeness was high and any undercoverage was minimal in final analyses.Most studies explicitly compared their estimated excess deaths to official COVID19 death counts from the national registry. Several introduced the concept of “non-COVID excess” – the portion of excess deaths not labeled as COVID19 – by subtracting official COVID deaths from total excess. For example, in the first pandemic phase (Feb–Mar 2020) about 13,000 excess deaths were not accounted for by reported COVID deaths (implying potential under-detection or indirect deaths). Studies in later periods found that the gap between excess and official COVID deaths narrowed (due to better testing and attribution), and in some instances even inverted slightly (with official COVID toll occasionally exceeding total excess in certain low-impact periods, suggesting that some COVID-tagged deaths were offset by fewer non-COVID deaths).Quality appraisal found that most peer-reviewed studies were of moderate to high quality. They used robust statistical methods and national data, and clearly acknowledged limitations. The primary sources of potential bias were in baseline estimation (e.g. using a short baseline like only 2019 could bias excess low if 2019 had a bad flu season, etc.) and attribution of excess to COVID19 vs other causes. Grey literature reports (e.g. ISTAT reports) were descriptive but considered reliable given they originate from official data. Preprints without peer review were used cautiously unless their results were confirmed by later studies. On balance, the evidence base provides a coherent and comprehensive quantification of excess mortality in Italy.Table 1.

Percent excess = (observed ? expected) / expected * 100%. Quality is a rough judgement based on data completeness and method (not a formal score).Excess Mortality Over Time (2020–2024)2020: Italy’s excess mortality in 2020 was unprecedented in the post-war era. Total deaths registered in 2020 were approximately 746,146, about 100,000 more deaths than the 2015–2019 annual average. Multiple studies converge on an estimate of roughly 99,000 excess deaths in 2020 (March–Dec), equating to an 18–19% increase over expected mortality. The vast majority of this excess occurred during two periods: the spring first wave (peaking in March–April 2020) and a late autumn second wave (peaking in November 2020). The first wave (Feb–May 2020) alone accounted for around 45,000–50,000 excess deaths. March 2020 was the deadliest month: in that single month, 26,350 excess deaths were recorded (+48.6%). To put this in perspective, by March 31, official COVID-19 deaths were 13,710, implying more than half of the excess (≈13,000 deaths) were not attributed to COVID at that time. Many of these were likely COVID-19 cases that went undiagnosed, particularly early on when testing was very limited. Indeed, retrospective seroprevalence data and analyses suggest actual COVID infections and deaths far exceeded reported numbers in Lombardy’s first wave. One modeling study estimated ~52,000 COVID-attributable deaths by mid-April 2020 – over twice the official toll – taking into account age-specific fatality rates and excess deaths.During April 2020, excess mortality remained high nationally (+33%), but began to decline as the strict lockdown (in place from early March) curbed transmission. By summer 2020, excess deaths had largely dissipated; June–September 2020 saw no significant excess and even some weeks with slightly below-baseline mortality (possibly due to rebound from the heavy toll earlier or fewer traffic fatalities in lockdown). However, in the fall of 2020, Italy experienced a second major wave following the relaxation of measures. Excess mortality surged again in October–December 2020. November 2020 was especially deadly, with national deaths ~40% above baseline. By the end of 2020, Italy had officially recorded ~75,900 COVID-19 deaths, whereas the excess death estimate (~100k) suggests around 24,000 additional pandemic-related deaths (some unconfirmed COVID, some indirect causes). That yields about 75% of excess accounted for by official COVID-19 classifications in 2020. These figures are summarized in Table 2.2021: In 2021, despite the rollout of vaccines (starting January 2021 for health workers and the elderly), Italy still saw substantial excess mortality, especially concentrated in the winter and again in late autumn. Total excess deaths in 2021 are estimated around 60,000–65,000 (+9–10%). The first quarter of 2021 saw a continuation of the second wave into January and a third wave peaking in March–April 2021 (driven by the Alpha variant). Excess mortality in Q1–Q2 2021 was significant but lower in magnitude than the 2020 waves. For example, one analysis found ~15% excess in January 2021 and ~10% in April 2021. By summer 2021, mortality returned near baseline. A noteworthy feature in 2021 was the geographic shift: regions in southern Italy (which had been spared in early 2020) experienced relatively higher excess mortality during some 2021 outbreaks. Sanmarchi et al. noted that in the June–October 2020 period, the South saw only +13.5% excess mortality officially attributed to COVID (indicating minimal outbreak), whereas in March–December 2021, the South/Islands region had some of the highest excess mortality relative to its baseline. Lower vaccination rates among the elderly in some southern regions and the spread of Delta variant in late 2021 contributed to these patterns.In late 2021 (Oct–Dec), Italy encountered the Delta wave. Excess deaths rose again, although the impact was heterogeneous. Nationally, October–December 2021 had an excess on the order of +5–10% (depending on the baseline). By end of 2021, cumulative excess deaths since the pandemic began were roughly 160,000–180,000, and official COVID deaths totaled ~137,000. Thus, across 2020–21, only about 76% of excess deaths were directly certified as COVID-19 – conversely, around one-quarter of pandemic-related excess deaths were not recorded as COVID. Some of these might be undetected COVID cases (especially early 2020), while others could be indirect deaths (e.g. from other illnesses aggravated by strained health services, or patients not seeking care). For instance, moderate increases in non-respiratory causes (like cardiovascular deaths) were observed during peak COVID waves in Italy, possibly indicating indirect effects.2022: The year 2022 began with the large Omicron wave. January 2022 saw a sharp rise in infections (Omicron’s peak) and considerable mortality among unvaccinated or very elderly individuals, although the per-case fatality was lower than earlier variants. Alicandro et al. reported 4,143 excess deaths (+6.1%) in January 2022. Interestingly, their analysis found no excess in working-age adults during that Omicron surge (consistent with Omicron being less severe and vaccines protecting younger groups). After January, COVID mortality declined in spring 2022, and some studies noted a period of near-normal mortality in late winter/spring 2022. However, by summer 2022, overall mortality climbed again above expected levels. Italy experienced an unusually intense heatwave in July–August 2022, overlapping with a mild resurgence of Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. Several reports highlighted this period as a compound impact scenario. An estimated 26,647 excess deaths (+10.2%) occurred from August to December 2022, which includes the tail of the summer and an early start to the influenza season in late autumn. The summer component was significant: Ceccarelli et al. (2024) found that weekly deaths among seniors closely tracked extreme temperature deviations, with a strong positive correlation in midsummer 2022. A Nature Medicine study attributed about 18,010 heat-related deaths in Italy in summer 2022 (the highest in Europe). Thus, a portion of excess mortality in 2022 – especially the ~20% spike in late July – can be attributed to heatwaves. It was noted that prior COVID survivors had slightly lower risk from the heatwave than those without COVID history, possibly because the frailest individuals had already succumbed during COVID waves.In the latter part of 2022, as BA.5 and seasonal flu circulated, moderate excess mortality continued until around December. By end of 2022, Italy’s cumulative excess deaths since 2020 reached roughly 226,000 (per Alicandro et al.), aligning with Pizzato et al.’s estimate of 227,000 through 2023. Meanwhile, official COVID deaths by end-2022 were ~180,000, implying about 46,000 excess deaths (20% of total excess) were not officially recognized as COVID over the three years. Many of these in 2022 were likely heat-related or otherwise indirect (unlike 2020’s unseen COVID cases). Notably, when Italy’s excess mortality in 2022 is partitioned: one analysis found a slight excess of +6% in January, no excess Feb–May, a renewed excess in mid-summer (peaking late July), and another rise in fall. Table 2 summarizes year-by-year figures.2023–2024: By 2023, Italy (like much of Europe) saw a normalization of mortality levels. High vaccination coverage, accumulated natural immunity, and the milder Omicron variant led to far fewer COVID-19 deaths (officially around 10,000 in 2023). Importantly, analyses show no sustained excess mortality in Italy during 2023. In fact, the first half of 2023 registered slightly fewer deaths than expected (approximately 2.1% below baseline, translating to ~7,000 fewer deaths). This “mortality deficit” is likely due to a rebound effect: some individuals who might have died in early 2023 had they survived the prior years were already lost in 2020–2022. Additionally, winter 2022–23 saw only a moderate flu season and no major new COVID variant wave, so mortality remained at or below normal levels. Pizzato et al. report only a 0.11 million excess deaths Europe-wide in 2023, with none in Italy. Preliminary data for 2024 continue this trend – no indications of significant excess mortality, barring localized fluctuations. Thus, by late 2022 the pandemic’s extraordinary impact on mortality had largely abated in Italy.Table 2. Excess mortality in Italy by year (2020–2023) and comparison with official COVID-19 deaths.YearObserved DeathsExpected DeathsExcess Deaths (absolute)Excess Mortality (%)Official COVID-19 DeathsExcess vs Official2020 (Mar–Dec)~580,000 (Mar–Dec) [Total 2020: ~746,000]~480,000 (Mar–Dec)+99,300+18.8%~75,900 (full year)Excess ~1.3? official (≈24k more)2021 (Jan–Dec)~713,000~651,000+61,800+9.5%~62,000 (year)Excess ~ equal to official (catch-up in attribution)2022 (Jan–Dec)~713,000~648,000+65,000 (est.)+10.0% (est.)~43,000 (year)Excess ~1.5? official (heat & indirect deaths)Subtotal 2020–22––~226,000~+13% vs 3-year baseline~181,000Official ~80% of excess (20% unaccounted)2023 (Jan–Dec)~700,000 (prov.)~707,000–7,000 (deficit)–1.0% (approx.)~10,000 (year)– (no excess; COVID deaths balanced by fewer other deaths)Total 2020–2023––~227,000+8.7%~191,000Official ~84% of excessSources: Observed deaths from ISTAT annual reports; expected and excess from Alicandro et al. and Pizzato et al.. Official COVID deaths from Italian Ministry of Health (via Worldometers/WHO). Note: 2020 excess here is Mar–Dec; if Jan–Feb (no excess) included, full-year 2020 excess ~ excess % slightly lower. 2022 breakdown: Alicandro et al. reported +4,143 in Jan 2022 and +26,647 in Aug–Dec 2022; the remainder (Feb–Jul) ~34k by difference.From Table 2, one can see the shift over time. In 2020, excess deaths exceeded official COVID deaths by ~30%. In 2021, official counts caught up such that excess ≈ official (suggesting most COVID deaths were being correctly identified). In 2022, excess again exceeded official count significantly (reflecting the heatwave and perhaps some unrecognized COVID among frail elderly). By 2023, there was no excess to speak of.Regional and Demographic PatternsRegional disparities: The excess mortality burden in Italy was very uneven geographically, especially in the first year. Northern Italy (the economic-industrial belt) was hit first and hardest. Within the North, Lombardy stands out: it suffered roughly 50% of all Italy’s excess deaths in the first wave despite having ~16% of the population. Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Brescia – Lombardy provinces – saw apocalyptic spikes. For example, during the week of 15–21 March 2020, Bergamo province recorded an 858% increase in deaths vs the 2015–19 norm. In that province, an estimated 0.57% of the entire population died of COVID-19 in the first wave alone, a level approaching the worst-hit cities globally. Other northern areas like Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and the province of Pesaro-Urbino (Marche) also saw large first-wave excesses (excess mortality >100% in March 2020). Central and southern regions initially had much smaller excesses; some southern provinces even showed negative excess (fewer deaths than normal in early 2020, possibly due to reduced travel and mild flu season).By the second wave (late 2020) and into 2021, the geography broadened. Excess mortality spread to every region of Italy, although still with higher absolute numbers in the more populous North. Sanmarchi et al. divided Italy into four macro-areas and five time periods in 2020–21; they found the Northwest and Northeast had the highest excess mortality rates in 2020, while in late 2021 the South and Islands region saw the highest relative excess. For instance, during March–July 2021, the Northeast experienced 140% as many official COVID deaths as excess deaths (suggesting possibly some mortality displacement or over-reporting in that period), whereas in mid-late 2021 the South had excess deaths far exceeding their previous baseline. Southern Italy’s worst phase came in late 2021, coinciding with when some of those regions had lower vaccine uptake among elderly and a surge of Delta variant cases. Overall, Lombardy (10 million population) still ended up with the largest share of national excess deaths over the full pandemic. One estimate through May 2021 showed Lombardy’s all-cause deaths were 0.29% of its population above expected, the highest regional PFR (population fatality rate) in Italy. However, in proportional terms (per population), several other northern regions and some small provinces had similarly heavy tolls. Conversely, some southern regions (Calabria, Basilicata) consistently had among the lowest excess mortality rates.It’s worth noting that within regions, socioeconomic disparities also emerged. A study of Turin (a northern city) found excess mortality was higher in poorer neighborhoods during spring 2020, suggesting socioeconomic vulnerability played a role even controlling for age structure. Nationwide, Sanmarchi et al. linked higher regional excess mortality with factors like lower trust in health institutions and lower adherence to mobility restrictions in surveys, as well as healthcare resource disparities. On a European scale, an analysis found that countries or regions with higher poverty rates and income inequality had significantly greater excess death rates, whereas higher health spending and vaccination coverage were associated with lower excess mortality. This aligns with the Italian internal pattern: the South, generally poorer and initially less resourced in healthcare, eventually caught up in mortality impact once the virus spread there. Meanwhile, the North’s early devastation was exacerbated by its dense population and international connectivity (introducing the virus earlier), despite being wealthier.Age and sex: COVID-19 mortality risk rises steeply with age, and excess mortality data mirror this. All studies indicate that the elderly (especially 75+ or 80+) accounted for the vast majority of excess deaths in Italy. For example, Ceccarelli et al. noted distinct excess mortality peaks “notably among individuals aged 80 years and older” in 2022, attributable to both COVID and heat. An ISS analysis of confirmed COVID deaths showed a median age in the upper 70s, and this reflects in excess deaths being concentrated in older age groups. Alicandro et al. estimated 13,039 excess deaths (+10.2%) in ages 25–64 from Mar 2020–Jan 2022, which is only ~8% of the total excess. In contrast, among seniors 65+, excess mortality was on the order of +15% or more, comprising over 90% of all excess deaths. There was effectively no detectable excess mortality in children or adolescents in Italy; COVID-19 deaths in those groups were extremely low, and any pandemic-related reduction in accidents etc. roughly balanced out.Interestingly, the sex distribution of excess deaths shows a slight male majority, but not as skewed as the confirmed COVID death sex ratio. Some studies (e.g. Scortichini et al.) stratified by sex and found both men and women experienced high excess mortality, though men had somewhat higher rates consistent with higher COVID fatality in men. Alicandro et al. reported 10,025 excess deaths among men vs 3,014 among women in working-age (25–64) groups through Jan 2022, indicating men ~4? the excess in that age range. In older ages, the male excess death rate was also higher, but since women live longer in Italy, the absolute number of excess deaths among women was also large. Overall, about 55–60% of excess deaths were male, 40–45% female, reflecting both demographic structure and vulnerability differences.Cause of death patterns: While not the primary focus of this review (which looks at all-cause mortality), it’s worth noting evidence on what causes drove the excess. COVID-19 (viral pneumonia and related complications) was obviously the main driver. An analysis by Rosano et al. of cause-specific mortality in spring 2020 found that the rise in deaths was largely due to pneumonia/respiratory causes and ill-defined causes (likely COVID), while deaths from non-respiratory causes like cancer did not show a compensatory drop – meaning the excess was truly additional mortality. Some indirect causes did contribute: cardiovascular deaths spiked during COVID surges in some data, possibly due to patients not getting timely care. Deaths from diabetes and Alzheimer’s also increased, potentially stress or care-disruption related. Conversely, external causes like traffic accidents fell during lockdowns, offsetting a small portion of excess deaths.Summary: Italy’s excess mortality experience can be summarized as follows: an early concentrated disaster in the North hitting the very old and frail, followed by a dissemination of mortality burden to the entire country, disproportionately affecting unvaccinated and older adults, and finally a tapering off by 2023 as the susceptible pool was reduced and interventions took effect. The interplay of direct virus effects and indirect effects (health system, environment) varied over time – direct COVID accounted for the bulk of excess in 2020–21, while in mid-2022 a substantial fraction of excess was due to extreme heat compounding with moderate COVID waves.Methodological Heterogeneity and UncertaintyThe range of excess death estimates across studies was relatively narrow for the nationwide total, enhancing confidence in the findings. By end-2021, for instance, different models gave estimates from ~165k to ~180k excess deaths (only ~10% difference). This is a testament to Italy’s high-quality death registration data. However, a few methodological points deserve mention:* Baseline choice: Studies using 2015–2019 averages vs those using regression with trend might differ. E.g., the Ministry of Health data (cited by Sanmarchi) giving 180k excess in 2020–21 likely did not fully adjust for aging trend, whereas Alicandro’s model (trend-adjusted) yielded ~165k by Jan 2022. The truth might be in between; a gradual rise in expected deaths (due to aging) means a simple historical average slightly overestimates excess. On the flip side, including 2020 in baseline (Eurostat’s 2016–19 baseline) underestimates excess a bit for 2021–22. Fortunately, these differences are small relative to the magnitude of excess.* Temporal resolution: Weekly vs monthly analysis can yield slightly different timing of peaks but overall totals align. The timing of peaks in some studies might differ by a week due to reporting lags.* Attribution of cause: Excess mortality doesn’t distinguish direct vs indirect causes, which is both a strength and limitation. For interpretation, one has to rely on other data (e.g. COVID case/death correlations, or heatwave timing). Most authors of these studies implicitly attribute the vast majority of excess deaths in 2020–2021 to COVID-19 itself. For 2022, authors like Alicandro and Ceccarelli explicitly attribute some excess to heat and perhaps delayed effects of the pandemic (like strained chronic care). Still, the uncertainty remains on exactly how many of the non-COVID-certified excess deaths were “hidden” COVID versus truly indirect. For example, the ISTAT report from 2020 suggested that in northern Italy’s March 2020 excess, perhaps 10–15% could have been indirect (e.g. heart attacks not treated) but the majority was likely uncounted COVID.* Confidence intervals: Where provided, CIs for excess death estimates (especially early waves) were relatively tight at national level (thanks to large numbers). For instance, an international study gave Italy’s 2020–2023 excess as 1.64 million for Europe, with Italy’s share 227,736 (CI ~1.61–1.68 million overall, implying a few thousand uncertainty for Italy). This is a minor uncertainty (<5%). On subnational levels, uncertainty is larger – small provinces had wide confidence intervals for weekly excess (making precise rank ordering of worst-hit provinces tricky beyond “Lombardy provinces were highest”).* Quality of input data: Italy’s death registration is very complete, but there were initial lags in reporting from some municipalities. The ISTAT provided timely data covering roughly 93% of municipalities by April 2020 and nearly 100% later. Thus, missing data were not a significant issue beyond the first weeks. Our included studies either waited for complete data or applied reasonable adjustments.In summary, despite different analytic strategies, the core finding – on the order of 220k excess deaths in Italy through 2022 – is robust. Minor discrepancies (e.g. one study says 178k by mid-2022 vs another 165k by Jan 2022) can be explained by timing and baseline differences. All studies agree on the qualitative patterns discussed above.DiscussionThis review provides a detailed synthesis of excess mortality in Italy attributable to COVID19 from 2020 through 2024. The evidence reveals that Italy experienced a very large surge in all-cause mortality – about 13% more deaths over 2020–2023 than expected in the absence of the pandemic. In absolute terms, an estimated 227,000 excess deaths occurred in that four-year period. This is one of the highest excess death tolls in Europe, second only to a few larger or similarly hit countries (e.g. Poland and Germany had ~220k each, but higher percentage in Poland). Italy’s excess mortality (+8.7% over 2020–23) was substantial, though not the highest in relative terms – countries in Eastern Europe like Bulgaria, or even neighboring Poland, saw higher percentage increases. Within Western Europe, however, Italy’s proportional excess was among the higher ones, reflecting the severe first wave and significant later waves. Importantly, the excess death count exceeded the official COVID-19 death count by approximately 25–30% in Italy. This gap suggests that official data underestimated the pandemic’s true death toll, due to undiagnosed COVID cases early on and additional fatalities indirectly caused by the pandemic (e.g. those stemming from strained healthcare or social conditions).Comparison with official counts: As noted, by end of 2022 Italy had about 226k excess deaths versus ~180k reported COVID deaths (i.e. ~46k more). Part of this discrepancy arises from the first epidemic wave. In March–April 2020, testing was scarce; many who died at home or in overwhelmed hospitals were never swabbed for the virus. Excess mortality analyses confirm roughly 50% more deaths than officially attributed to COVID in that first wave. Over time, this undercounting diminished – by 2021, with extensive testing, the ratio of excess to official COVID deaths approached 1:1 nationally. In some months in 2021–22, official COVID deaths even slightly exceeded excess deaths (suggesting some offset by below-expected non-COVID deaths, possibly due to mild flu seasons or preventive measures reducing other causes). One extreme example was in the Northeast region for Mar–Jul 2021, where the percentage of excess officially attributed to COVID was 140%, implying non-COVID mortality was unusually low (perhaps lockdowns and masks cutting flu). Overall though, for the pandemic as a whole, Italy’s official COVID-19 tally captured roughly 80–85% of the total excess deaths. This is actually a relatively high ascertainment rate compared to some countries where official counts captured only half or less of excess deaths (e.g. many developing countries, or even some European countries early on). It reflects Italy’s effort to count COVID deaths (e.g. including those with comorbidities). It also means about 15–20% of Italy’s excess deaths might be attributed to indirect effects or conditions exacerbated by the pandemic rather than acute COVID infection.Temporal dynamics: The patterns in Italy’s excess mortality mirror the waves of the pandemic but also illustrate an evolution in impact. The initial catastrophic spike in spring 2020 stands out – a truly unprecedented mortality shock in modern Italian history, concentrated in a short time and geographic area. This was followed by a second wave that was more spread out nationwide but still deadly in late 2020. The availability of vaccines by early 2021 changed the landscape: while excess deaths continued into 2021, they likely would have been far higher without vaccination (which averted many deaths among those infected, especially in older age groups). Excess mortality in the second half of 2021 and into 2022 was attenuated relative to earlier waves, except where other factors intervened (like the heatwave). By 2023, as observed, Italy (and Europe broadly) entered a new phase where COVID-19 was causing much fewer deaths and even allowing a slight mortality deficit, as some people who might have died of other causes had already passed earlier (the so-called “harvesting” effect). This pattern of excess mortality peaking in 2020–2021 and receding by 2023 has been noted in other high-income countries with successful vaccination campaigns.Regional and policy implications: The regional analysis underscores how outcomes could have been different with earlier interventions in certain areas. Northern Italy’s severe losses in the first wave revealed gaps in pandemic preparedness – hospitals overwhelmed, testing capacity initially insufficient, and perhaps delayed lockdown in the very early days. The fact that southern Italy had minimal excess in spring 2020 shows that aggressive lockdowns and mobility restrictions (which were applied nationally by March 9, 2020) protected less-exposed regions. However, the later convergence of mortality impact across regions by late 2021 indicates that no region ultimately escaped. Differences in cumulative excess deaths per capita between North and South narrowed as the pandemic progressed. A concerning finding is that a notable portion of excess deaths, even beyond direct COVID, occurred in areas with socioeconomically vulnerable populations. This suggests that health disparities likely widened during the pandemic – wealthier regions and communities might have had better capacity to mitigate indirect mortality (through healthcare access, remote work, etc.), whereas poorer areas suffered more once the virus reached them. Policymakers should heed these findings: strengthening healthcare infrastructure uniformly across regions and addressing social determinants of health can improve resilience to future crises.Indirect factors: The case of the 2022 heatwave is instructive. Italy’s excess mortality in summer 2022 was among the highest in Europe due to record temperatures. Without COVID, those heat deaths still would have occurred, but COVID possibly exacerbated vulnerabilities (e.g. recovering patients or those with lung damage could be more heat-susceptible). Conversely, Giorgi Rossi et al. found prior COVID survivors had slightly lower heat-mortality risk, hypothesizing that the most frail were removed from the population by COVID. Regardless, it underlines the need for integrated surveillance: during a pandemic, other public health threats (like heatwaves) can compound the mortality impact. Public health authorities should ensure that measures (e.g. heat emergency plans) are maintained even amidst a pandemic.Another indirect effect is the strain on healthcare. Italy’s hospital systems, especially ICU capacity, were stretched in 2020–21. Non-COVID services were reduced. It is plausible that some excess deaths were due to delayed treatments (for cancer, heart disease, etc.) or patients avoiding emergency care. Some Italian studies have documented increased out-of-hospital heart attack deaths during COVID peaks. Quantifying this is challenging, but the “non-COVID excess” portion gives a clue. For Italy, maybe ~20-30k of the excess deaths through 2021 were not identified as COVID or acute respiratory deaths. Some of those could be indirect fatalities worth addressing in pandemic planning – for example, ensuring continuity of care for critical non-COVID conditions.International context: Italy’s experience was somewhat intermediate in Europe. Countries like the UK, Spain, and Belgium also saw high excess mortality early on, whereas others like Germany and Denmark had lower first-wave impact but caught up later (Germany’s excess deaths by 2022 nearly matched Italy’s in absolute count). Eastern Europe generally fared worse in later waves due to lower vaccination. Italy’s rapid vaccine rollout likely prevented a worse toll in late 2021–2022. Studies show a clear inverse correlation between a country’s vaccination rate and its excess death rate in 2021–22. Italy was on the better side of that equation, achieving high uptake and likely saving tens of thousands of lives (e.g., fewer excess deaths in the elderly in late 2021 compared to scenarios of low vaccination).One peculiarity: Italy’s official COVID death reporting was relatively inclusive (counting deaths “with COVID”). This led to some discourse if Italy over-counted COVID deaths. However, our review indicates under-counting of total impact was more of an issue; even if a few non-COVID deaths were misclassified as COVID, far more COVID deaths were missed early on, and additional deaths occurred from system stress. The alignment of total excess with pandemic trends validates that COVID (directly or indirectly) was driving the excess; when COVID waves subsided, mortality returned to baseline or below (as seen in mid-2020 and in 2023). This temporal association strongly supports causality: e.g., Italy’s week-by-week excess mortality curve mirrors its COVID case and death curve.Limitations of this review: We acknowledge that our review has limitations. First, while we aimed to be comprehensive, relevant new studies may continue to emerge (especially analyzing full 2023–24 data) after our search period. We included a few preprints for the most recent information; their results should be interpreted with caution until peer-reviewed. Second, in synthesizing studies with different methods, there is a degree of comparing apples and oranges. We attempted to present ranges and central estimates rather than overly precise figures. Third, our review did not formally quantitatively pool results (no meta-analysis), due to heterogeneity – instead, we qualitatively summarized them. However, the consistency across independent analyses lends confidence to our conclusions.Fourth, excess mortality is a blunt metric; we cannot definitively break down how many excess deaths were “due to COVID-19 infection” versus “due to other causes stemming from the pandemic.” Some researchers have attempted to estimate that using cause-of-death data, but cause-of-death attribution during a pandemic can be unreliable (e.g., some heart attacks might actually be caused by COVID infections). Our focus on all-cause mortality avoids needing to assign cause, but the flip side is we sometimes infer causes indirectly.Finally, quality assessment noted that a few studies (especially subnational ones) were limited by small sample sizes or less rigorous methods. We gave them less weight in the synthesis. For example, if a local study claimed a certain pattern that wasn’t echoed by national data, we treated it cautiously. Encouragingly, most local findings (e.g., worse outcomes in deprived areas) were indeed consistent with national trends or other countries’ experiences.Public health implications: The findings from Italy reinforce several important points for public health and emergency response:* Excess mortality tracking is vital. Had we relied only on confirmed COVID-19 deaths, we would underestimate the pandemic’s impact by potentially 20% or more in Italy, and even more elsewhere. Real-time mortality surveillance (like ISTAT’s weekly reporting) should be strengthened and used alongside case counts to gauge when a health crisis is worsening. Italy’s integration of excess mortality monitoring (e.g., through ISS reports) allowed recognition that the first wave was causing many more deaths than initially known. This metric should be a standard tool in future pandemics or disasters.* Protect vulnerable populations early. The Italian data show that once COVID-19 breached nursing homes and elderly populations, mortality exploded. Focused protection (though challenging in practice) and early intervention in hotspots is critical. Northern Italy’s experience suggests that delaying lockdown even by days can lead to large loss of life when exponential spread is underway. In contrast, proactively shielding less affected regions (as happened in the South in spring 2020) can delay and reduce impact – buying time to prepare healthcare resources.* Healthcare system capacity and adaptability: Regions with stronger healthcare and public health infrastructure appear to have managed subsequent waves better. For instance, by the second wave, fatality rates dropped because treatments improved and hospitals had expanded ICU capacity. Ensuring surge capacity (staffing, beds, oxygen) in all regions can reduce excess deaths, both direct and indirect.* Vaccination and public health measures work: The reduction in excess mortality in 2021–22 relative to uncontrolled 2020 indicates the effect of vaccines and continuing precautions. Areas of Italy with higher vaccination among seniors saw smaller excess peaks in late 2021 (per some regional reports), whereas areas with hesitancy saw more excess deaths. This is a tangible outcome that can be communicated to counter vaccine hesitancy: thousands of excess deaths were averted by immunization.* All-cause approach for evaluation: When evaluating the success of pandemic policies, excess mortality provides a bottom-line metric largely free from testing biases. For example, if one were to judge Italy’s pandemic response, one could note it had lower cumulative per-capita excess mortality than some countries that delayed strong measures, but higher than those that responded faster (e.g., some Nordic countries). This can inform future policy decisions on the balance between public health measures and their timing.Future research: There are still unanswered questions. A detailed demographic decomposition of Italy’s excess mortality (by age, sex, region, cause) could illuminate how much of the loss in life expectancy was due to direct vs indirect causes. Some work in this vein is ongoing (e.g. cause-specific analyses). Additionally, long-term monitoring is necessary: while 2023 saw no excess, there is interest in whether certain population subgroups (like long COVID patients or those who missed treatments) might have elevated mortality risks in subsequent years. So far, no obvious such signal has emerged in Italy’s data, but researchers will continue examining mortality trends for aftershocks.Another avenue is comparing expected vs observed births and overall population changes – Italy saw a baby bust in 2020–21 and population decline, which alongside excess deaths has societal implications. Though beyond our scope, it’s part of the pandemic’s demographic impact.Limitations of the data: We should note Italy’s excess mortality could include some positive effects (fewer accidents, etc.) that mask even higher COVID-specific toll. For example, road deaths dropped during lockdown, which reduces excess mortality a bit. There were ~3,000 fewer transport accident deaths in 2020 than 2019 in the EU; Italy contributed to that. Had those remained constant, Italy’s net excess would be slightly higher. Such nuances mean our figures may slightly understate the true burden of COVID-19 but capturing all-cause impact is still the best comprehensive measure.In conclusion, Italy’s experience underscores that excess mortality is an indispensable metric in a pandemic. It captures the full sweep of the crisis – from the tragedy in Lombardy’s overwhelmed hospitals to the silent toll of isolated elderly in a heatwave – in one measure. For Italy, that measure amounts to roughly a quarter million lives lost unexpectedly in a span of three years, a profound national trauma. Fortunately, by 2023 the trend reversed, highlighting the effectiveness of control measures and perhaps marking the close of the emergency phase.ConclusionsItaly suffered a severe mortality shock due to the COVID19 pandemic, with an estimated 220,000–230,000 excess deaths from 2020 through 2022 – about 13% more deaths than would normally have occurred in that period. This excess mortality quantifies the pandemic’s full impact, exceeding the official COVID-19 death count (~190,000 by early 2025) by roughly 20–25%. The gap represents initially under-detected COVID deaths and broader indirect effects of the pandemic. Excess deaths in Italy were heavily concentrated among the elderly and in the country’s northern regions during the first year, though later waves affected all regions and saw significant mortality even in the South. Three pandemic waves (spring 2020, autumn 2020–winter 2021, late 2021–mid 2022) account for most of the excess deaths, while by 2023 mortality returned to expected levels, indicating an end to the acute phase of the pandemic’s impact.Analyzing excess mortality proved crucial for revealing the true scale and geography of COVID-19’s toll in Italy. It highlighted that thousands of COVID-related deaths were missed in official counts early on and that health crises like heatwaves can amplify mortality during a pandemic. For public health practice, Italy’s experience demonstrates the need to invest in robust civil registration and real-time mortality monitoring, and to use this data to guide responses. In future emergencies, tracking excess deaths can provide early warning of under-recognized fatalities and help target interventions (such as surge medical support to hotspots).The Italian data also reinforce the importance of timely interventions (lockdowns, vaccinations) and strong health systems: areas and periods with effective measures saw fewer excess deaths. To reduce mortality in any similar scenario, officials should ensure rapid response in outbreak epicenters, protect vulnerable groups, and maintain essential health services to minimize indirect losses. Furthermore, as climate-related events like extreme heat are likely to recur, integrating pandemic preparedness with other disaster preparedness (e.g. heat action plans) is recommended.In summary, excess mortality analysis in Italy portrays a comprehensive picture of the COVID19 pandemic’s human cost. We recommend that policymakers continue to utilize excess mortality alongside cause-specific data to evaluate public health strategies. While Italy has now exited the emergency with mortality back to normal levels, ongoing vigilance is needed. Public health authorities should capitalize on improved surveillance systems, invest in resilience (particularly for elderly care and chronic disease management), and address regional health inequalities that were exposed by the pandemic. By learning from the patterns of excess mortality, Italy and other countries can better protect their populations in the face of future public health threats.Recommendations:* Surveillance: Maintain and strengthen real-time all-cause mortality surveillance (e.g. ISTAT’s weekly reporting), and incorporate it into routine public health assessments. This will enable early detection of unusual mortality clusters whether from infectious disease, weather events, or other causes.* Data transparency: Continue publishing excess mortality analyses during health crises to inform the public and guide policy. Italy’s collaboration between ISTAT and ISS to produce timely mortality reports was a good practice that should be sustained.* Targeted protection: Use data to identify which groups are at highest risk (elderly, nursing home residents, lower socioeconomic areas) and prioritize them for interventions like vaccinations, boosters, and outreach during pandemics or disasters.* Healthcare system strengthening: Increase surge capacity and ensure continuity of care for non-pandemic conditions. For example, develop protocols so that even during a COVID surge, critical treatments (for heart attacks, cancers) remain accessible to avoid indirect mortality spikes.* Integrated response plans: Align pandemic response plans with other emergency response (like extreme weather), recognizing that multiple stressors can coincide. The 2022 heatwave deaths in Italy during COVID illustrate this need. Public health messaging and resources should be adaptive to concurrent threats.* Further research: Support studies that evaluate excess mortality at granular levels – e.g., municipality or neighborhood – to detect local vulnerabilities. Also, study long-term effects: will there be any lasting impact on mortality trends or health outcomes for COVID survivors? Early signs suggest no sustained excess in 2023, but continued monitoring is warranted.By implementing these recommendations, Italy can honor the lessons learned from the painful excess mortality of 2020–2022. The nation’s experience, documented through the studies reviewed here, contributes to global knowledge on pandemic impacts and will inform how we tackle public health crises moving forward, striving to minimize loss of life.ReferencesAlicandro, G., Gerli, A.
